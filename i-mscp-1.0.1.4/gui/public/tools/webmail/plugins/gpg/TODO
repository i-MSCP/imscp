The current TODO list of the GPG development team is maintained in two places:

    - In the code, where @todo tags are parsed daily and placed here:
    
      http://www.braverock.com/gpg/phpdoc/

    - The official repository for enhancements to the GPG Plugin is at:

      http://www.braverock.com/bugzilla/

If you want to sign up to take care of something, please contact the development 
team at gpg@braverock.com.

There is also a Known Problems Section below, update this as necessary.

If you want to add something to the TODO list, please feel free to do so by 
adding an enhancement request to the GPG Plugin Bugzilla.
