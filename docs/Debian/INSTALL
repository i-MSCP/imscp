4) Installation
---------------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.4.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.4

3. Install the required modules
   First update your system:

	# aptitude update && aptitude safe-upgrade
	# aptitude install lsb-release
	# aptitude install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-`lsb_release -cs`)

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/            lenny         main contrib non-free
   deb     http://security.debian.org/              lenny/updates main contrib non-free

	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site'. 'mail name' should be
	the server's domain. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain
	should be already shown.)
	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Build the Software by using make:
	# make install

6. Copy all the directories into your system. If you have not yet, now is a good
   time to make backups of your server. The following steps do fundamental
   changes to your system configuration.
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/* /

7. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	# mysql_secure_installation

8. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and
	start the engine setup:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup
	# perl ispcp-setup

9. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -fR /tmp/ispcp/

================================================================================
5) Update
---------
NOTE: ispCP ω can only be updated from 1.0.0, 1.0.1 or 1.0.2. If you have a
version prior 1.0.0 (final release) installed, update to ispCP ω 1.0.0 first.

Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.4.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.4

3. Install the required modules
   first update your system:
	# aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
	# aptitude install lsb-release
	# aptitude install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-`lsb_release -cs`)

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/            etch         main contrib non-free
   deb     http://security.debian.org/              etch/updates main contrib non-free

	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site' and then type 'root'
	for mail. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain should be
	already on screen. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(if you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. Stop the ispcp_deamon and build the Software by using make:
	# /etc/init.d/ispcp_daemon stop
	# make install

5. Backup files
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/messager/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/

	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/config.inc.php /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data/* /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data/

	# rm -fR /var/www/ispcp/engine/
	# rm -fR /var/www/ispcp/gui/{admin,client,include,orderpanel,themes,reseller}/
	# rm -fR /var/www/ispcp/gui/*.php

	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/usr/* /usr/
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/var/* /var/

   backups):
	# mv /etc/ispcp/ispcp.conf /etc/ispcp/ispcp.old.conf
