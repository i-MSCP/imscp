Add Address plugin for SquirrelMail
===================================
Ver 1.0.3, 2010/02/02


Copyright (c) 2008-2010 Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>



Description
===========

This plugin helps users add addresses to their address book
from incoming and outgoing messages quickly and easily.  It
pulls email addresses from the headers and body (only if the
user chooses to scan the body) of received messages, optionally
verifies the DNS records of the addresses and presents a list
for editing before adding to the address book.  It can also
add all the addresses found in the destination headers in
outgoing messages with no user interaction whatsoever.

Note that if the Address Take plugin is activated at the same
time, it will clash with this one - it is superseded by this
plugin, so it should be deactivated.  The Address Add plugin
is also superseded by this plugin.



Usage
=====

Users can add addresses found in any one message by clicking
on a link added to the "Options" line below the message headers
on the message view screen.  Options for controlling how the
message is scanned as well as control over the feature that
adds addresses from outgoing messages automatically are all
found under Options --> Display Preferences --> Address Book.

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.0 (although the feature that
    adds addresses from outgoing messages will not work
    unless using SquirrelMail 1.4.6 or above)

  * Compatibility plugin version 2.0.7 or above, unless
    using SquirrelMail version 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If addresses are not being added as expected, first verify
    the user preference settings found under Options --> Display
    Preferences --> Address Book.  Next, check all address
    book backends to determine if the address(es) not being
    added are already in one of them.

  * If the "Attempt To Verify Addresses Being Added To Address
    Book" preference setting does not save correctly, verify that
    the Address Take plugin is not also activated.

  * If performance seems to drag when this plugin is active,
    turn off the "Attempt To Verify Addresses Being Added To Address
    Book" setting - if this helps, review your DNS server settings
    and performance settings.

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be showing
    in the user interface, ensure that you are editing the correct
    configuration file.  If one is located in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory (named "config_add_address.php"), it will
    always be used.  Otherwise, "config.php" in the add_address
    plugin directory will be used.
