2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.0

3. Install the required modules
   First update your system:
	# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

   for Debian Sarge please use:
	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-sarge`

   	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-etch`
   for Debian Lenny/Sid please use:
   	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-lenny`

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/            etch         main contrib non-free
   deb     http://security.debian.org/              etch/updates main contrib non-free

   If using Sarge, make sure you have added the following backport into your
   /etc/apt/sources.list:

   # backports
   deb     http://dotdeb.pimpmylinux.org/          sarge          all


	(when you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(when you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site' and then type 'root'
	for mail. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain should be
	already on screen. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(when you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(when you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

6) FAQ
------

Q.- How can I prevent websites using more than their bandwidth limit to stop working?
A.- If you have installed the apache2-mod-cband (available for etch and lenny/sid)
     all you need to do is:
       # a2enmod cband
     note that you might want to review /etc/apache2/mods-available/cband.conf
     to disable the /cband-status and /cband-status-me handlers.

Please check http://www.isp-control.net for any questions not answered in this file.
