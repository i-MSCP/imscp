Installing Fortune Plugin
=========================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin.  Example below uses "fortune" as the name of the 
directory:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /usr/archives/fortune_plugin.tar.gz

You may have to edit plugins/fortune/setup.php and change the location
of fortune on your system. Simply modify the $fortune_location variable
This script was written on RedHat 6.2 as such fortune is expected in 
/usr/games/fortune. Plugin works only when PHP safe mode is disabled.

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin (+).  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl
