# i-MSCP 1.3.x Serie (James Horner) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [./docs](.) directory.

## Version 1.3.15

### New policy for usernames set through setup dialogs

The policy for usernames set through setup dialogs, including inside the
preseed file, has been updated:

- Usernames must be between 3 and 16 characters long.
- Only ASCII alphabet, number and underscore characters are allowed.

Note that following this new policy, you could have to enter new usernames
during upgrade.

### Policy for passwords set through the setup dialogs

Policy for passwords set through the i-MSCP setup dialogs, which was updated in
i-MSCP version `1.3.1`, is now enforced, even for existing installations.
Following this change you could have to enter new passwords during upgrade.

### Setup dialog boxes for passwords

Setup dialog boxes for passwords are now automatically pre-filled with a
password that is autogenerated. You're free to use that password or enter your
own.

## Version 1.3.12

### 10_apache2_dualstack.pl listener file

If you use the `10_apache2_dualstack.pl` listener file, which provides
dual-stack feature for Apache2, you're greatly encouraged to update it to the
new version available in the contrib directory of this new i-MSCP version.
Indeed, major issues were found in that listener which can cause serious
problems in your i-MSCP installation .

You **MUST** update that listener prior any update attempt.

## Version 1.3.9

### Apache2 with mod_proxy_fcgi

Due to all issues caused by the `ProxyErrorOverride` directive, we have decided
to disable it. We now provide an alternative solution with the mod_rewrite
module. In short, a request for a PHP script is now passed through
`mod_proxy_fcgi` only if the PHP script exists on the file system.

See https://i-mscp.net/index.php/Thread/15502 for further details.

#### Note for PhpSwitcher plugin users

If you use the PhpSwitcher plugin, you must update it to latest version,
before upgrading to this new version.

### Database password (i-MSCP Master SQL user password)

Because i-MSCP now uses the AES-256 (Rijndael) algorithm in CBC mode to encrypt
data (was Blowfish in CBC mode previously), the database keys file will be
automagically regenerated and you'll be asked again for the SQL data.

### Upgrade support for i-MSCP versions older than 1.1.0

Upgrade support for i-MSCP versions older than 1.1.0 has been dropped. If you
want upgrade your i-MSCP installation from a version older than 1.1.0, you must
first upgrade to i-MSCP version 1.3.8, then upgrade to this new version.

### Support for custom DNS NS resource record

Support for custom DNS NS resource record has been added. However note that
usage of this DNS resource record is restricted to subzone delegation.

For instance let's imagine that you host the `domain.tld` zone. If you want
delegate the `sub.domain.tld` subzone to an external DNS server, you can
process as follow:

1. Add the `sub.domain.tld. 3600 IN NS ns1.sub.domain.tld.` custom DNS `NS`
resource record
2. Add the `ns1.sub.domain.tld. 3600 IN A 192.168.1.110` custom DNS `A`
resource record (a.k.a glue record)

## Version 1.3.8

### AWStats authentication

The Apache2 `mod_dbd` authentication provider is no longer used for AWStats
authentication process. AWStats login credentials are now stored in the
`/etc/apache2/.imscp_awstats` file which is processed by the Apache2
`mod_authn_file` authentication provider.

Note that the `imscp_awstats` SQL user which was previously needed is not
removed automatically by the installer. You  must remove it manually.

### Bind9 db.tpl template file

The `db.tpl` template file has been updated. If you have replaced this template
by your own template, you should check for changes that were made in this new
version.

Note that if you want reuse the same name servers for all your DNS zones, you
should now use the dedicated listener that is available at:


    https://github.com/i-MSCP/imscp/blob/1.3.x/contrib/Listeners/Named/10_named_global_ns.pl

 
By using this listener file, you will make your life easier. Editing the db.tpl
file directly is not recommended.

### Control panel user passwords (transitional)

Control Panel user passwords are now hashed using the `APR-1` algorithm. The
update is fully automatic. The password hashes are updated on next successful
login.

Note that due to this change, customers won't be able to connect to AWStats
interface as long as their password is not updated. They will have first to
connect to the control panel.

Be aware that this is a transitional change. In near future, all passwords
will be hashed using `bcrypt`, when the support for Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu
Precise will be dropped. Right now, we cannot use bcrypt because the
`mod_auth_basic` module from Apache 2.2.x (required by AWStats) doesn't
supports bcrypt.

### Duplicate mounts (customer httpd log folders)

If you do have duplicate mounts for your customer httpd log directories, you
must remove them prior updating to this new version. This can be done easily by
running the following command from the i-MSCP archive:

```
perl contrib/scripts/fix_duplicate_mounts.pl
```

This command unmount any mount found under the `/var/www/virtual directory`. If
you are not sure, it is recommended to run this command.

Note that depending of the number of duplicate mounts, this command can take up
several minutes.

### dpkg(1) post-invoke tasks

i-MSCP is now able to trigger some tasks after that dpkg(1) has been invoked.
Any `dpkgPostInvokeTasks()` method defined in the i-MSCP servers/packages will
be automatically invoked when necessary.

For instance, the `Package::FrontEnd` package defines a `dpkgPostInvokeTasks()`
method that is responsible to update the PHP binary for the `imscp_panel`
service when the system PHP binary is being updated.

Therefore, don't be surprised if you see any i-MSCP debug output when running
APT. This is the expected behavior.

## Version 1.3.6

### Editable document root

The customers can now setup an alternative `DocumentRoot` for each of their
domains. This feature is mostly needed for PHP frameworks such as `Symfony` or
`Zend Framework` where the default skeleton defines a specific subfolder for
the public resources.

The alternative `DocumentRoot` must pre-exist and must be located in the default
`/htdocs` directory of the domain for which it is being set.

Note that if URL forwarding feature is activated for the domain and that the
default `/htdocs` directory doesn't exist yet, there is not possibility to
setup an alternative `DocumentRoot`. In such a case, the customer must first
deactivate the URL forwarding feature.

Be also aware that this feature is only implemented for the edit pages. When a
domain or subdomain is being created, there is no possibility to setup an
alternative `DocumentRoot` because at this time, the `/htdocs` directory
doesn't exist yet on the file system. This is by design.

### Proxy loop caused by the ProxyErrorOverride directive (Apache2 ≥ 2.4.10)

Due to a bug present in the Apache2 `mod_proxy_fcgi` module, the
`ProxyErrorOverride` directive causes a infinite loop when a PHP application
(such as ownCloud) handles the error documents via PHP. This new version fix
the problem by patching the module with a patch taken from the upstream
repository.

See https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55415 for further details
about the issue.

Be aware that it is assumed that you use the Apache2 packages provided by your
distribution.

#### dpkg diversion

For keeping our own version of the `mod_proxy_fcgi` module when Apache2 is
being updated via APT, we've added a dpkg diversion (see dpkg-divert(8)). If
after an APT update, you encounter a problem with Apache2, and more specially
with the `mod_proxy_fcgi` module, you should process as follow:

##### First step - Removing the dpkg diversion

First, be sure that the `/usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so-DIST` file
exists. If the file doesn't exist, this probably means that there is no dpkg
diversion and thus, you can skip this step

```
service apache2 stop
rm /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so
dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so
```

Doing this will remove the diversion and reinstall the `mod_proxy_fcgi.so`
module which is provided by your distribution package. Of course now, your
version of the `mod_proxy_fcgi` module will have the bug specified above.

##### Second step - Re-applying the patch and re-creating the dpkg diversion

```
cd <imscp_archive_dir>/autoinstaller/postinstall
sh fix_apache2_mod_proxy_fcgi.sh
```

This will rebuild the `mod_proxy_fcgi` module and re-recreate the dpkg
diversion.

## Version 1.3.4

### Mount/Umount events propagation

Due to many problems that appeared, following changes made in the version 1.3.2
regarding the mount/umount events propagation, it has been decided to revert
them. If you're upgrading from a version ≥ 1.3.2, you must run the following
commands before starting the installer:

```
umount -l /var/www/virtual
umount -l /var/www
mount -a
```

These commands will revert the changes introduced in previous i-MSCP versions.
Note that before running these commands, it is recommended to stop the
following services:

- apache2
- Ftp service (either protfpd or vsftpd, depending on your setup)
- imscp_panel

## Version 1.3.2

### Mount/Umount events propagation

To fulfil the i-MSCP requirements in regard of the mount/umount events
propagation, and to say compatible with virtual environments such as `OpenVZ`,
both, the `/var/www` directory and the `/var/www/virtual` directory are now
mounted on themselves as follow:

- `/var/www` is mounted on himself as slave subtree
- `/var/www/virtual` shared is mounted on himself as shared subtree
 
The `/etc/imscp/mounts/mounts.conf` file will contains the following entries:

```
# fstab-like configuration file - auto-generated by i-MSCP
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
/var/www /var/www none bind,slave
/var/www/virtual /var/www/virtual none bind,shared
    ...
```

Note that directory paths can differ according your installation layout.

## Version 1.3.1

### Pre-update tasks

#### Plugins:

Due to major changes made in the iMSCP::Mount library, versions of InstantSSH
plugin older than 5.0.0 are not compatible with this new version. Thus, if you
use that plugin, you need to disable it first. Once the update done, you must
upgrade your InstantSSH plugin with the last available version.

Note: If you also use the CronJobs plugin, you must disable it as well.

#### Services

Before running the i-MSCP installer, you must stop the `imscp_panel` service
manually.

### AWStats authentication

Due to a security issue which has been fixed in that new version, the customers
can now connect to AWStats interface only by using their control panel login
data.

### Database update

Due to two major updates for the database, and depending on amount of traffic
data you have in your i-MSCP database, the update process may take several
minutes.

### i-MSCP frontEnd (imscp_panel service)

#### Listening ports

The listening ports for the i-MSCP frontEnd were changed to make them
compatible with CloudFlare. The new ports are:

- http: 8880
- https: 8443

Note that this change only affects new i-MSCP installations.

#### PHP processes

The i-MSCP frontEnd is now run through its own PHP FPM instance. Previously,
the frontEnd was run through PHP CGI with `spawn-fcgi`.

### New policy for passwords set through setup dialogs

The policy for passwords set through setup dialogs, including inside the
preseed file, has been updated:

- Passwords must be between 6 and 32 characters long.
- Only ASCII alphabet and numbers characters are allowed.

Note that these changes don't affect existing installations of i-MSCP as long
as the services are not reconfigured.

### IP addresses management

#### Configuration modes

It is now possible to choose the configuration mode for IP addresses that are
added through the i-MSCP administration interface. These modes are `auto` and
`manual`.

Note that the `manual` mode is only appropriate on servers for which network
interfaces are configured through DHCP, or when you must set a specific netmask
for the target IP address.

Be also aware that the configuration mode for the server primary IP address is
set to `manual' by default.

##### Auto configuration mode

In this mode, i-MSCP will automatically configures the target IP address if not
already present in the `interfaces` configuration file. This involve the
following tasks:

###### When adding a new IP

- Adding the IP address configuration into the `interfaces` file
- Bringing the network interface up

###### When removing an IP

- Removing the IP address configuration from the `interfaces` file
- Bringing the network interface down

##### Manual configuration mode

In this mode, i-MSCP will remove any entry which would have been previously
added for the target IP address in the `interfaces` configuration file and skip
its configuration. In such case, the configuration is left to the
administrator.

Note that in this mode, i-MSCP won't try to bring up nor bring down the network
interface.

#### Installer

It is no longer possible to configure additional IP addresses through the
installer. From now, the installer will only ask you for the server's primary
IP address.

Note that by default, the server's primary IP address will always be set with
the `manual` configuration mode. You're free to change the configuration mode
through the administration interface.

#### Netmask

It is now possible to set/edit the netmask for each IP address.

Note that if you choose the `manual` configuration mode for the IP address,
the netmask is only informational.

#### Network interface card (NIC)

It is now possible to edit the NIC for each IP address.

Note that if you choose the `manual` configuration mode for the IP address,
the NIC is only informational.

### Pages for disabled domains (accounts)

The pages for disabled domains have now their own skeleton directory (e.g.
/etc/imscp/skel/domain_disabled_pages) which is copied into the root Web
directory (e.g. /var/www/virtual) during installation.

The pages for disabled domains are now stored outside of the customer home
directories.

### PHP opcode cache

The PHP opcode cache (OPcache or APC) is now enabled by default if you use PHP
as Apache2 module (ITK), or through
PHP-FPM.

To make this change, two new parameters were added into the
`/etc/imscp/php/php.data` configuration file which are:

#### PHP_OPCODE_CACHE_ENABLED

This parameter allows the administrator to enable/disable the PHP opcode cache
for the customers. Default value is
`1` (enabled).

**Note:** If you change the value of this parameter, you must not forget to run
the `imscp-reconfigure` script.

#### PHP_OPCODE_CACHE_MAX_MEMORY

This parameter allows the administrator to setup the amount of memory that can
be used by the PHP opcode cache. You must not forget that the PHP opcode cache
is shared across all customers. This is by design and this cannot be changed.
Default value for this parameter is `128 MiB`. However, if you host several PHP
applications, and if you have enough memory available on your server, it is
recommended to increase this value accordingly.

**Note:** If you change the value of this parameter you must not forget to run
the `imscp-reconfigure` script.

## Version 1.3.0

First of all, if you're updating from a version older than `1.2.16`, you should
read the 1.2.x errata file. You can find that file in the ./docs directory of
the i-MSCP archive.

### Pre-update tasks

Prior to any update attempt, you must deactivate all plugins through the plugin
interface. Once the update is done, you must update all your plugins to latest
available version, and re-activate them one by one. If something goes wrong
with a plugin, you can post in the plugins support section, and our development
team will fix the issue as soon as possible.

### External mail feature

The external mail feature has been greatly simplified. From now, activating the
external mail feature for a domain only configures i-MSCP mail server to relay
mail through external MX. The MX and SPF DNS resource records for external mail
servers are no longer created by i-MSCP. The customers must now create those
DNS resource records by themselves, either through their registrar interface if
they use the DNS server provided by their registrar, or  through the custom DNS
resource records interface if their DNS are managed by i-MSCP server.

Note that following those changes, the external mail feature has been reseted,
meaning that customers will have to reactive it if needed.

### FTP usernames

VsFTPd doesn't support non-ASCII characters in usernames. Therefore, to be
compatible with VsFTPD and ProFTPD, the internationalized domain names (IDN)
that are part of FTP usernames will be converted to ACE form. This means that
only ASCII usernames will be accepted.

You must not forgot to warn your customers about this change.

### i-MSCP master SQL user

Starting with this version, usage of SQL root user is prohibited. Instead, a
dedicated SQL user for i-MSCP is created. This change intends to solve issues
with SQL servers that are configured to use passwordless authentication. With
such a configuration, password for the SQL root user is not set while package
installation. Instead, the authentication is done through a unix socket (a
mapping between the local unix user and the SQL user is done.)

Note that while installing or reconfiguring i-MSCP, the installer will still
ask you for the SQL root user info when needed. However, this user will be only
used to create and grant privileges to i-MSCP SQL users. This means that i-MSCP
will never store any data related to the SQL root user, nor change any of its
properties.

Be also aware that in latest versions of the i-MSCP PhpMyAdmin package, usage
of SQL root user has been prohibited for security reasons. If you want connect
to PhpMyAdmin to work on all databases, you should now use the i-MSCP master
SQL user.

### imscp-setup script

The `imscp-setup` script has been renamed to `imscp-reconfigure`.

### Parameters

#### Apache2 MOUNT_CUSTOMER_LOGS parameter

This new parameters allows the administrator to disable mount of customers
httpd log directories. To disable them, you can process as follow:

```
sed -i'' 's/^\(MOUNT_CUSTOMER_LOGS\s\+=\).*/\1 no/' /etc/imscp/apache/apache.data
perl /var/www/imscp/engine/setup/imscp-reconfigure -danv
```

Be aware that when mount of httpd log directories is disabled, the `logs`
directory located in the home directory of customers is also removed.

### Permissions on customer's files (Http Web folders and Maildir)

Starting with this version, permissions on customer files are no longer set
recursively by default. This allows to avoid long running processes when a
customer has thousands of files in his Web folders or mail directory.
 
To enable recursion, you must now pass the `--fix-permissions` option to the
installer (or any script supporting it). 

The `--fix-permissions` option is supported by the following scripts:

 - imscp-autoinstall (i-MSCP installer)
 - imscp-reconfigure (i-MSCP reconfiguration script)
 - set-engine-permissions.pl (Script that set engine permissions)

Note: If you're migrating i-MSCP data from one server to another, you must not
forget to set this option while running the imscp-reconfigure script.

### imscp_mountall service

This `imscp_mountall` service mounts i-MSCP file systems when the server is
rebooted. This service reads entries in a fstab-like file located at
`/etc/imscp/mounts/mounts.conf`. Unlike the entries that are added in the
system fstab file, the entries added in this file are always processed in
sequential order.

Third-party software components that want add entries in that file must use the
API provided by the iMSCP::Mount library.

### Custom DNS resource records

#### MX DNS resource record

It is now possible to setup MX DNS resource records through the custom DNS
resource records interface. Be aware that default MX DNS resource records,
as the SPF DNS resource records, are removed only if the external mail
feature is turned on for the target domain.

#### DKIM/DMARC TXT DNS resource records

It is now possible to add DKIM/DMARC TXT DNS resource records.

#### SPF DNS resource record

To fulfit specific requirements, the SPF DNS resource record type has been
added to the list of allowed custom DNS resource records. It is now possible to
setup custom SPF records using SPF and TXT DNS resource records. However you
must be aware that when a custom SPF DNS resource record is detected (SPF or
TXT), the default SPF DNS resource records set by i-MSCP are automatically
removed.

**Note:** As per the RFC 7208, the SPF DNS resource record is deprecated.
However it is still required in some contexts.

#### TTL (Time to Live)

It is now possible to set a TTL value for any custom DNS resource record.
Previsously, this was only possible for the SRV DNS resource record. The TTL
value must be expressed in seconds. Note that for safety reasons, it is not
allowed to specify a value lower than 60 seconds.

#### Validation rules for the name, canonical name and target host fields

If you do not specify a fully-qualified domain name for one of these fields
(domain name ending by DOT) they will be automatically completed with your
domain name (domain for which you add the record). For instance, if you add
a DNS resource record for the `test.tld` domain, and specify the following
label for the `name` field:

```
 sub
```

it will be automatically completed with your domain name as follow:

```
    sub.test.tld.
```

You must also be aware that the out-of-zone records are not allowed. Simply
put, if you specify:

```
google.fr.
```

for the `name` field, it will not pass validations.

Anyway, even if that were allowed, the DNS resource record would be ignored by
the DNS server. For instance, adding such DNS resource record for the
`test.tld` zone:

```
google.fr.    IN    A    192.168.1.110
```

would lead to:

```
named-compilezone -i none -s relative -o - test.tld test.tld.db 
test.tld.db:27: ignoring out-of-zone data (google.fr)
zone test.tld/IN: loaded serial 2016031403
...
```
