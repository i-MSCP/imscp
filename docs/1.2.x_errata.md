# i-MSCP 1.2.x -- Errata

## Update to version 1.2.3

### Plugins compatibility

Major changes were made in the plugin API, which break compatibility with old plugins versions. Therefore, before
updating to this new version, you must disable all plugins.

Once that the update is done, you must update each plugin by uploading the last version available from our plugin store.
Be aware that some plugins are not yet ready for use with this new version, such as the **Mailman** and **OwnDDNS**
plugins which require further works.

Plugin which are known to work with this new version clearly states that they are compatible with i-MSCP version >=
**1.2.3**.

### Info for plugin's developers

#### Plugin API changes

##### New plugin.plugin_config_prev database field

A new **plugin.plugin_config_prev** database field as been added, which allows to store the previous plugin configuration.
This field is automatically filled by the plugin manager when the plugin configuration file is being updated.

From the frontend, you can access the previous plugin configuration using one of the following methods:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrev()</strong>
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			Allows to retrieve all previous configuration parameters
 		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrevParam()</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Allows to retrieve a single previous configuration parameter
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

From the backend, you must fetch and decode the field manually as done for the **plugin.plugin_config** field.

##### New require_api info field

The new plugin API version introduces a new plugin info field ( **require_api** ), which allows you to define the i-MSCP
plugin API version that is required by your plugin. Thus, by declaring this field ( mandatory ), it is no longer needed
to implement API version compatibility check in the main plugin class. All is now done automatically by the plugin
manager, based on the value of the require_api field.

#### Backend changes

##### New CustomDNS module

This new version comes with a new **CustomDNS** module which allows to process custom DNS records without involving a
rebuilt of files which belong to HTTP server implementations ( vhost file, php files... ). This also allows to process
the custom DNS records more faster than before because from now they are managed by a dedicated module.

In past, each time you wanted add or delete a custom DNS record, it was mandatory to rebuilt the full configuration of
the domain ( vhost file, php file .. ). This involved a lot of tasks done for nothing and this was not without pose any
problems such as the useless reload of Apache ( eg. when using a plugin such as OwnDDNS which needs to update the DNS
zone files very often through a cron job ).

From now, if you want add your own DNS records, you must simply add them into the domain_dns table with the correct
status ( toadd, todelete... ) and trigger a backend request ( only needed if you add the record through the FrontEnd ).

**Note:** All this also apply to the listeners files.

## Update to version 1.2.1

### Package's restricted SQL users

The minimum length for usernames and passwords is now 6 characters long. Due to this change, it is possible that during
the update you need to update them.

### Webmails

Multiple webmails are now supported. You can install either no webmail, one webmail or many webmails at same time. You
can reconfigure list of webmails to install by running the following commands:

```shell
# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr webmails
```

At this moment Roundcube and RainLoop webmails are available.

## Update to version 1.2.0

### Pre-update tasks
 
Prior to any update attempt, it is greatly recommended to deactivate all plugins through the plugin interface. Once the
update is done, you must re-activate the plugins one at a time. If something goes wrong with a plugin, you can post in
the plugins support section, and our development team will fix the issue as soon as possible.
 
### i-MSCP frontEnd access
 
i-MSCP 1.2.0 introduces support for the Nginx Web server which is currently used only by the i-MSCP frontEnd. From now,
the i-MSCP frontEnd is run through a dedicated httpd instance, and is reachable through the following http(s) ports:

```
8080 ( http )
4443 ( https )
```

You can set different ports by editing the /etc/imscp/imscp.conf file, and by re-running the i-MSCP installer. Be aware
that the common http(s) ports ( 80 and 443 ) are reserved, and therefore, must not be used. If you want keep access to
the panel though these ports, you can install the following plugin which will act as a proxy:

* https://github.com/i-MSCP/plugins/tree/master/incubator/PanelRedirect
 
Having the i-MSCP frontEnd running with a dedicated httpd instance means that even if your Apache instance is down, the
panel will stay reachable. You can manage the i-MSCP frontEnd service with the following commands:

```shell
# service imscp_panel <action>
# service nginx <action>
```

### Hook files / Listener files
 
Hooks files are now known as listener files. A listener file is a Perl script which contains one or many event listeners
registered on the events manager and triggered by the same. The old **/etc/imscp/hooks.d** directory has been renamed to
**/etc/imscp/listeners.d** directory for consistency reasons.
 
### Installer command line options
 
Many options were either added, removed or simply renamed. You can get the full list of available command line options
by running the following command:

```shell
	# perl imscp-autoinstall -?
```
