Migration from ispCP to i-MSCP

This intends to be a guide for those interested into migrate your control panel from
ispCP to i-MSCP. Luckily there's a standard migration path ready for us.

Currently you can migrate from ispCP 1.0.7 to i-MSCP 1.0.3.0 or newer.

IMPORTANT: Test it before with a clone of your system, there could be problems and
it's important to find them during the test phase.

1.  Download the current version of i-MSCP from http://i-mscp.net/download
2.  Untar the downloaded file

    # tar -xzf i-mscp-1.0.3.0.tar.gz

3.  Start the installation of the system (as you would for a new install), but
    IMPORTANT, when you see the Installer options screen, select the 'build' option,
    because you've to continue using the console instead of this installer.

    # perl imscp-autoinstall --debug

4.  Copy the generated files into their destination, after this point there's
	NO POSSIBLE ROLLBACK

    # cp -fR /tmp/imscp/* /

5.  It's interesting to have the debug enabled to inspect possible problems, you have
    to change in /etc/imspc/imscp.conf

    DEBUG = 1

6.  Now you have to use the migration script which will be already in place.

    # cd /var/www/imscp/engine/setup/
    # perl imscp-migrate-from-ispcp

7.  After the run of this script you'll have to run the regular install

    # perl /var/www/imscp/engine/setup/imscp-setup --debug

If all the steps are fine, you should be able to enter in the control panel
Some considerations

The logs for either a failed or successful setup will be at /var/log/imscp/imscp-setup.log

    # less /var/log/imscp/imscp-setup.log

The database user MUST have full privileges (including GRANT) else, it won't be able to create and
populate the i-MSCP database and create customer database.
