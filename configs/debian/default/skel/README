Web folder skeletons
====================

This directory contain skeletons used by the i-MSCP httpd server implementations to create either domain, domain alias
or subdomain Web folders. You can customize these skeletons by adding your own directories with content of your choices.

IMPORTANT: You should not delete the directories and files already present unless you know exactly what you are doing.
