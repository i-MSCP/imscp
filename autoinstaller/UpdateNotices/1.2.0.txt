=======================\Zn\ZB

\Zb\Z4# Pre-update tasks\Zn\ZB

Prior to any update attempt, it is greatly recommended to deactivate all plugins through the plugin interface. Once the update is done, you must re-activate the plugins one at a time.

If something goes wrong with a plugin, you can post in the plugins support section, and our development team will fix the issue as soon as possible.

\Zb\Z4# i-MSCP frontEnd access\Zn\ZB

i-MSCP 1.2.0 introduces support for the Nginx Web server which is currently used only by the i-MSCP frontEnd. From now, the i-MSCP frontEnd is run through a dedicated httpd instance and is reachable through the following http(s) ports:

        \Zb8080 (http)
        4443 (https)\ZB

If you want keep access to the panel though common ports (80 , 443), you can install the \ZbPanelRedirect\ZB plugin which will act as a proxy.
