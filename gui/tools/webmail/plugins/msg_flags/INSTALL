Installing Message Flags & Icons
================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.4.10 version of the Message
   Flags plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf msg_flags-1.4.10-1.4.3.tar.gz

2) Change into the msg_flags plugin directory and patch your 
   SquirrelMail source code.  Make sure you use the patch file 
   that pertains to your version of SquirrelMail: the patch 
   for SquirrelMail 1.4.3a should work for versions up to 1.4.9.

  $ cd msg_flags
  $ patch -p0 < patches/msg_flags-squirrelmail-1.4.10.diff

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

3) (Optional: the only reason to do this is for use with the Plugin
   Updates plugin) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  
   Choose option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  ----- optional -----
  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
  ----- optional -----

4) Also, if not being used with SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

5) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:
