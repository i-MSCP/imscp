Q.- How can I prevent websites using more than their bandwidth limit to stop working?
A.- If you have installed the apache2-mod-cband (available for etch and lenny/sid)
     all you need to do is:
       # a2enmod cband
     note that you might want to review /etc/apache2/mods-available/cband.conf
     to disable the /cband-status and /cband-status-me handlers.
