SquirrelSpell plugin
--------------------

Modify the sqspell_config.php file making sure you have ispell or aspell
available on your system and located in PHP's path. The squirrelspell
doesn't check for that and if it is not available, you're just going to
get a "No errors found" message every time. :) Quite pleasing, but not
very useful.

Read files in "doc" directory -- they explain some features.

Enable the plugin either by hand or by running the configure script from
your SquirrelMail install directory.

NOTE: If you are using php >= 4.3.0 squirrelspell should work in safe mode.
Otherwise, you may have to disable safe mode for the squirrelspell directory.
   APACHE CONF EXAMPLE:
        <Directory /webroot/squirrelmail/plugins/squirrelspell>
                php_admin_value safe_mode 0
        </Directory>


Enjoy and report bugs. ;)

       SPELL-CHECKING APPLICATIONS:
       ----------------------------
       This feature was added/changed in 0.3. Use this array to set up
       which dictionaries are available to users. If you only have
       English spellchecker on your system, then let this line be:

       $SQSPELL_APP = array("English" => "ispell -a");

       or

       $SQSPELL_APP = array("English" => "/usr/local/bin/aspell -a");

       Sometimes you have to specify full path for PHP to find it.
       Aspell is a better spell-checker than Ispell, so you're encouraged
       to use it.

       If you want to have more than one dictionary available to users,
       configure the array to look something like this:

       $SQSPELL_APP = array(
    			"English" => "aspell -a",
                            "Russian" => "ispell -d russian -a",
    			...
    			"Swahili" => "ispell -d swahili -a"
    		       );

       Watch the commas, making sure there isn't one after your last
       dictionary declaration. Also, make sure all these dictionaries
       are available on your system before you specify them here.

       Whatever your setting is, don't omit the "-a" flag.

    **/
    $SQSPELL_APP = array('English' => 'ispell -a');

    /**
       DEFAULT DICTIONARY
       -------------------
       Even if you're only running one dictionary, still specify which one
       is the default. Watch the case -- it has to be exactly as in array
       you declared in $SQSPELL_APP.
    **/
    $SQSPELL_APP_DEFAULT='English';

    /**
       USER DICTIONARY:
       -----------------
       $SQSPELL_WORDS_FILE is a location and mask of a user dictionary file.
       The default setting should be OK for most everyone. Read PRIVACY and
       CRYPTO in the "doc" directory.

    $SQSPELL_WORDS_FILE = "$data_dir/$username.words";

    /**
       CASE SENSITIVITY:

       Use $SQSPELL_EREG="ereg" for case-sensitive matching of user
       dictionary, or $SQSPELL_EREG="eregi" for case-insensitive
       matching. It is advised to use case-sensitive matching.

       SOUP NAZI (AVOIDING BAD BROWSERS)
       -------------------------------------
       Since some browsers choke on JavaScript, here is an option to disable the
       browsers with known problems. All you do is add some part of an USER_AGENT
       string of an offending browser which you want to disable and users will not
       know about this plugin. E.g. browsers with "Mozilla/4.61 (Macintosh, I, PPC)"
       USER_AGENT string will get weeded out if you provide "Macintosh" in the
       config string.

       Mozilla/2 -- You're kidding, right?
       Mozilla/3 -- known not to work
       Opera -- known not to work
       Macintosh -- Netscape 4.x on Macintosh chokes for some reason.
                    Adding until resolved.
