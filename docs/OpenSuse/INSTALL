================================================================================
2) Requirements
---------------
There is no must have for a system using ispCP ω. This is only a recommendation:

Penitum III or K6-4 with 500 MHz
512 MB RAM
100 MB disk space (only for install of ispCP ω)

All OpenSuSE 11.1 required packages are listed in ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse111-packages
All OpenSuSE 11.2 required packages are listed in ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse112-packages

================================================================================
3) Specific Note
----------------
PHP4 related packages are removed because they are not available! Therefore PHP4
is not available in ispCP!!! If you want to use PHP4 compile it by yourself!!!

For OpenSuse, the "apache2-mod_cband" package has been removed because it is
not available. If you want to use, you must compile it yourself.

Postfix note: Currently, Postfix does not run in a chroot jail. See the CHANGELOG
for more information.

For ispCP 1.0.3 , we recommand to use OpenSuSE 11.1 due to several issues
related to PHP5.3

================================================================================
4) Introduction
---------------
ispCP ω delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With ispCP ω you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of ispCP ω are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. ispCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

5) Installation
---------------
First, make sure you are logged in as root.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.3.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.3

3. Install the required repositories:
	# sh ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse111-repositories add

Note: For all questions, answer "a" (trust always).

4. Install the required packages:

	OpenSuse 11.1 (Recommended for ispCP 1.0.3)
	# zypper in $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse111-packages)

	OpenSuse 11.2
	# zypper in $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse112-packages)

5. Install more perl libraries from the Perl Archive Network:
	# cpan CPAN

	# For OpenSuse 11.1 (Recommended for ispCP 1.0.3)
	# cpan $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse111-perl-packages)

	# For OpenSuse 11.2
	# cpan $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse112-perl-packages)

6. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

7. Build the System by using make:
	# make -f Makefile.opensuse install

8. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups before)
	# cp -RLv /tmp/ispcp/* /

9. Start MySQL, if not running:
	# rcmysql restart

10. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	# mysql_secure_installation

11. Maybe empty the folder /etc/skel - otherwise you'll have all the files/folders in the home folders...
	# cp -a /etc/skel /etc/skel.bkp
	# rm -r /etc/skel && mkdir /etc/skel

12. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and
	start the engine setup:
	# cd /srv/www/ispcp/engine/setup
	# perl ispcp-setup

13. Process to specific OpenSuse post installation tasks
	# sh postinst configure

14. Restore /etc/skel
	# rm -r /etc/skel && mv /etc/skel.bkp /etc/skel

15. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

16. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -Rf /tmp/ispcp
