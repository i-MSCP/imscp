# i-MSCP 1.2.x Serie (Andromeda) -- Errata

## Version 1.2.16

### imscp_network service

This `imscp_network` service, which was responsible to configure IP addresses
on the fly and set iptables rules for the traffic logger, has been removed.

### imscp_traffic service

This new service sets iptables rules for the traffic logger on server boot.

### IP addresses management
 
IP addresses that are added via the i-MSCP control panel are now added into the
network interface configuration file. Doing this allow us to no longer depend
on the MySQL server when the server is rebooted (the possibility of the MySQL
server being unavailable for unknown reasons), and also, this provides a better
integration with the system. To resume, IP addresses are now configured using
interface definitions in the network interface configuration file, instead of
being configured on the fly using data pulled from the i-MSCP database.
 
IP addresses are added in the network interface file using aliased (virtual)
interfaces. Those types of interfaces have names of the form interface:integer.

To avoid collisions with manually configured interfaces, i-MSCP uses integers
starting at 1000. Thus, any IP addresses added through the i-MSCP control panel
will have an entry such as:
 
```
# i-MSCP [eth0:1002] entry BEGIN
auto eth0:1002
eth0:1002 inet static
        address <IP>
        netmask 255.255.255.255
# i-MSCP [eth0:1002] entry ENDING
```
 
#### IP addresses manually configured
 
IP addresses that are already present in the network interface configuration
file can also be added in the i-MSCP control panel for use with i-MSCP. In such
case, i-MSCP simply skip the configuration step for them. In other words,
i-MSCP doesn't manage those IP addresses.

Be aware that IP addresses which are not present in the network interface
configuration file will be added by i-MSCP, using virtual interfaces. If you
want to avoid this, you must add them in your network interface configuration
file, even if that is not really needed due to your environment (e.g: LXC
containers).

#### Netmask, Broadcast and Gateway
 
At this time, it's still not possible to setup the netmask, the broadcast and
the gateway through the i-MSCP control panel. This is a feature that will be
implemented in near future. However you should note that both options, the
broadcast and the gateway, are normally not needed when configuring virtual
interfaces.

## Version 1.2.15

### Ftpd server implementations

This new version introduce support for VsFTPd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) server
that can be used as alternative to the
ProFTPD server.

You can switch to this new Ftpd server implementation by running the following
command:

```
perl imscp-autoinstall -dr ftpd
```

## Version 1.2.12

### Backup feature

The `ZIP` parameter which allows to choose compression algorithm for backup
archives has been renamed to `BACKUP_COMPRESS_ALGORITHM`. The new default value
for that parameter is set to `bzip2` instead of `pbzip2`. This allows to
mitigate the CPU time consumption on virtual servers.
 
A new `BACKUP_COMPRESS_LEVEL` parameter has been added, which allows to choose
the compression level for backup archives. The default value is set to `1` to
mitigate the CPU time and the memory comsumption on virtual servers. Note that
this parameter is only relevant when the `BACKUP_COMPRESS_ALGORITHM` is set to
a value other than `no`.

### Hosting plan feature

The hosting plan feature at the administrator level has been removed. From now,
only the resellers can setup hosting plans. Remember that i-MSCP doesn't offer
any billing management system. The hosting plan feature is only provided to
fulfil requirements for some plugins such as BoxBilling and KaziWhmcs, or to
create new client accounts through i-MSCP interface without having to fill the
limits and features.

### Mail sent to local root user 

The email address set for the administrator during i-MSCP installation is now
automatically added as an alias address in the `/etc/aliases` file for the
local root user. This means that any mail sent to the local root user will be
automatically forwarded to the administrator email address.

### PHP Editor feature

#### Cascading permissions - Synchronization

From now, if you change a PHP configuration option for a specific reseller,
this will also affect all its clients. For instance, if you change the memory
limit for a reseller from 256 to 128, the memory limit of all its clients will
be also lowered if higher than 128.

The same thing occurs for the PHP permissions. For instance, If you change a
reseller permission from 'yes' to 'no', the PHP permission will be also removed
for its clients.

The rule here is: A client cannot have higher privileges than his reseller.

#### PHP error reporting (apache_itk httpd server implementation)

When using the ITK apache2 httpd server implementation, it is no longer
possible to setup error reporting level through the PHP editor. This decision
was taken due to the fact that it's not possible to use PHP constants in
Apache2 vhost files, and that constant values differ between PHP versions. From
now, if you use ITK, your clients will have to define the error reporting level
at runtime.

#### Per user, per domain or per site PHP configuration level

The PHP editor now operates according the PHP configuration level that has been
choosen by the administrator during the i-MSCP installation or reconfiguration
phase. For instance, when the PHP configuration level is set to 'per_site', a
client will be able to set different PHP configuration options for its sites
(if allowed).

### PHP-FPM (apache_php_fpm httpd server implementation)

Support for TCP/IP has been added. Be aware that using TCP/IP instead of UDS
(Unix domain socket) can require a tweaking of your kernel parameters (sysctl).
This is mostly needed for servers that host several high traffic sites.

You can have a look at [imscp_net_sysctl.conf](imscp_net_sysctl.conf) for a
sysctl configuration file example.

#### PHP configuration options (Admin level) 

The PHP configuration options at the administrator level were removed because
they were too much confusing. From now, if you want limit all clients, you must
limit their resellers. For instance, you can change a PHP configuration option
value for a reseller without giving him more permissions on the PHP editor. By
doing this, this will override default PHP configuration option value for all
its clients.

### Procmail package

A conflict has been added for the procmail package in the distribution package
files, meaning that when running the i-MSCP installer, this package will be
automatically removed. If you need Procmail, you must edit the distribution
package file `docs/\<distro\>/\<distro_package_file\>.xml` and remove the
following snippet:

```
<package_conflict>
    procmail
</package_conflict>
```

Note also that the `mailbox_command` Postfix configuration parameter, which is
used by the local delivery agent, is no longer set with the external procmail
command.

### SASL authentication backend

Cyrus SASL is no longer used for SMTP authentication (Postfix side) when
Dovecot is choosen for PO server. The Dovecot SASL implementation is used in
place.

### SQL servers

Support for MySQL 5.6.x/5.7.x, Percona 5.7.x and MariaDB 10.1 has been added.
Note that support for these versions is still experimental.

#### Disabled features

Performance Schema and event scheduler features were disabled for performance
reasons. If you need them, you can create your own .cnf file in the
/etc/mysql/conf.d directory. The file must be named in such a way that it will
be loaded after the `/etc/mysql/conf.d/imscp.cnf` file.

#### Switch policy

Switch policy for SQL servers has changed. It is no longer possible to switch
from/to MariaDB vendor from/to other vendors, excepted for MariaDB 5.5. MariaDB
is taking its own road with more and more dedicated features. Therefore, it
becomes difficult for us to provide an upgrade path for other SQL server
vendors (MySQL, Percona) without requiring any manual intervention.

Note that it is always possible to switch to another vendor manually. Simply
put, this task is now left to the administrator.

## Version 1.2.3

### Supported distributions

Support for both Debian Squeeze (6.x) and Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04) has been
removed. If you want to update to this new version, you must first update your
distribution to either:

- Debian ≥ Wheezy (7.x) if you're using Debian
- Ubuntu LTS ≥  Precise Pangolin (12.04) if you're using Ubuntu

### Pre-update tasks

#### Plugins

Major changes were made in the plugin API, which break compatibility with old
plugin versions. Therefore, before updating to this new version, you must
delete all plugins.

Once the update is done, you must reinstall each plugin by downloading the
latest version available from our plugin store. Be aware that some plugins
are not yet ready for use with this new version, such as the `Mailman` and
`OwnDDNS` plugins which require further works.

Plugins which are known to work with this new version clearly states that
they are compatible with i-MSCP version ≥ `1.2.3`.

##### Event listeners

Be aware that the transitional `iMSCP::HooksManager` package, which was an
alias of the `iMSCP::EventManager` package since i-MSCP version `1.1.14`, has
been removed. Thus, if you're using that package name in one of your listeners,
you must change it to `iMSCP::EventManager`, which is the real package name.

#### PHP version in use

If you're using, either `Debian Wheezy` or `Ubuntu Precise` with a PHP version
that is not provided by official repositories, you must be aware that the
`php-apc` package has been added in the list of package to install. Because
that package is no longer provided for PHP versions > `5.4`, you must remove
the package from the packages file before upgrading, else, packages
installation will fail.

You can find the packages file inside the i-MSCP archive, under the
`docs/\<distro\>` directory.

#### Services

You must stop all i-MSCP services manually before updating, else, some of them
will be unable to restart at the end of process.

You can stop the i-MSCP services as follow:

```
service imscp_panel stop
service imscp_daemon stop
service imscp_network stop
```

**Note:** The `imscp_panel` service is only available if you're upgrading from a
version released under the i-MSCP serie `1.2.x`

#### /root/.my.cnf file

The `/root/.my.cnf` file is no longer used by i-MSCP. Because this is a local
file, the i-MSCP installer will not remove it during update. Thus, if you have
a database connection problem with the i-MSCP backup scripts after update, just
remove the mysqldump section from this file.

### Info for plugin's developers

#### Plugin API changes

##### New plugin.plugin_config_prev database field

A new `plugin.plugin_config_prev` database field as been added, which allows to
store the previous plugin configuration. This field is automatically filled by
the plugin manager and you should never update it manually.

From the frontend, you can access the previous plugin configuration parameters
using one of the following methods:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrev()</strong>
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			Allows to retrieve all previous configuration parameters
 		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrevParam()</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Allows to retrieve a single previous configuration parameter
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

From the backend, you can access the previous plugin configuration parameter
using the `config_prev` property of the plugin.

Be aware that usage of parameters from previous configuration is only relevant
in the `disable()`, `update()`, `change()` and `uninstall()` methods, whatever
the context (from the frontEnd or the backend). Indeed, once the `change()`
method has been run successfully, the `plugin_config_prev` field is filled with
the last configuration applied on the plugin (the configuration coming from the
`plugin_config` field)

More generally, the parameters coming from the previous configuration allow to
do some deconfiguration / uninstallation tasks.

##### New plugin properties (backend)

From now, the plugin manager automatically decodes the plugin info, config and
config_prev fields and sets them as plugin properties. Thus, it is not longer
required to fetch these fields manually nor decode them.

To be more clear, the following news properties are set on plugin instances:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>info</strong>
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			Property which contains decoded plugin info field
 		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>config</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Property which contains decoded plugin config field
		</td>
	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>config_prev</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Property which contains decoded plugin config_prev field
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

##### New require_api info field

The new plugin API version introduces a new plugin info field `require_api`,
which allows you to define the i-MSCP plugin API version that is required by
your plugin in the info.php file. Thus, by declaring this field (mandatory), it
is no longer needed to implement API version compatibility check in the main
plugin class. All is now done automatically by the plugin manager, based on the
value of the require_api field.

#### Backend changes

##### New CustomDNS module

This new version comes with a new `CustomDNS` module which allows to process
custom DNS records without involving a rebuilt of files which belong to HTTP
server implementations (vhost file, php files...). This also allows to process
the custom DNS records more faster than before because from now they are
managed by a dedicated module.

In past, each time you wanted add or delete a custom DNS record, it was
mandatory to rebuilt the full configuration of the domain (vhost file, php file
...). This involved a lot of tasks done for nothing and this was not without
pose any problems such as the useless reload of Apache (e.g. when using a
plugin such as OwnDDNS which needs to update the DNS zone files very often).

From now, if you want add your own DNS records, you must simply add them into
the `domain_dns` table with the correct status (e.g. toadd) and trigger a
backend request (only needed if you add the record through the FrontEnd).

**Note:** All this also apply to the listeners files.

## Version 1.2.1

### Package's restricted SQL users

The minimum length for usernames and passwords is now 6 characters long. Due to
this change, it is possible that during the update you need to update them.

### Webmails

Multiple webmails are now supported. You can install either no webmail, one
webmail or many webmails at same time. You can reconfigure list of webmails
to install by running the following command:

```
perl imscp-autoinstall -dsr webmails
```

At this moment Roundcube and RainLoop webmails are available.

## Version 1.2.0

### Pre-update tasks
 
Prior to any update attempt, it is greatly recommended to deactivate all
plugins through the plugin interface. Once the update is done, you must
re-activate the plugins one at a time. If something goes wrong with a plugin,
you can post in the plugins support section, and our development team will fix
the issue as soon as possible.
 
### i-MSCP frontEnd access
 
i-MSCP 1.2.0 introduces support for the Nginx Web server which is currently
used only by the i-MSCP frontEnd. From now, the i-MSCP frontEnd is run through
a dedicated httpd instance, and is reachable through the following http(s)
ports:

```
8080 (http)
4443 (https)
```

You can set different ports by editing the `/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file, and by
re-running the i-MSCP installer. Be aware that the common http(s) ports (80 and
443) are reserved, and therefore, must not be used. If you want keep access to
the panel though these ports, you can install the following plugin which will
act as a proxy:

- https://github.com/i-MSCP/plugins/tree/master/incubator/PanelRedirect
 
Having the i-MSCP frontEnd running with a dedicated httpd instance means that
even if your Apache instance is down, the panel will stay reachable. You can
manage the i-MSCP frontEnd service with the following commands:

```shell
service imscp_panel <action>
service nginx <action>
```

### Hook files / Listener files
 
Hooks files are now known as listener files. A listener file is a Perl script
which contains one or many event listeners registered on the events manager and
triggered by the same. The old `/etc/imscp/hooks.d` directory has been renamed
to `/etc/imscp/listeners.d` directory for consistency reasons.
 
### Installer command line options
 
Many options were either added, removed or simply renamed. You can get the full
list of available command line options by running the following command:

```
perl imscp-autoinstall -?
```
