"Your local SquirrelMail administrator may have specified site settings for "
"one or more options or per-folders items.  In such a case where there is a "
"site setting, it supersedes the user setting (except as noted for particular "
"items below).  Since the site settings are administered separately, your "
"user settings are shown and can be edited even if site settings supersede "

"corresponding user setting in the User Preferences table and the Folder "
"Table."

"This is an explanation for the user preferences and per-folder data which "
"control selective automatic pruning of folders.  Pruning means the deletion "
"of messages either because they are older than a certain date or to bring a "
"folder to within a certain total size limit or number of messages."
"<ul><li>Pruning first considers message dates (if there is a user-specified "
"date span value for that folder).  A message's date is the time since it was "
"received by the mail server (this so-called 'internal date' is preserved if "
"you move a message between folders).  Messages are deleted if they have an "
"internal date older than the age indicated by the date span value.</"
"li><li>Pruning next considers total folder size (if there is a user-"
"specified folder size span).  If the folder is over that size limit, "
"additional messages are pruned until the folder is at or below it.</"
"li><li>Pruning finally considers the number of messages in the folder (if "
"there is a user-specified count span).  If a folder has more than that many "
"messages, additional messages are pruned until the folder is at or below the "
"limit.</li></ul><p>In all those pruning cases, unread messages are normally "
"protected and not pruned.  That protection can be removed on a folder-by-"
"folder basis.  Pruning behavior may be flexibly controlled using a variety "
"of other user preferences, each of which is described more fully below.  "
"Unsubscribed and non-existent folders are listed if there is any user "
"preference or site preference given for that folder; this is to avoid a "
"surprise if you suddenly start using a folder of some name and would not "
"otherwise realize that it had pruning options."

msgid ""
"For the 'Sent' folder, prune messages older than a week, including unseen "
"messages.  This assumes you don't use your 'Sent' folder as a general "
"collecting area.  If you haven't needed to retrieve something from there in "
"a week (because you forgot to save a copy elsewhere), it can be tossed out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the 'Trash' folder, prune messages older than 3 days.  Prune the 'Trash' "
"folder to no more than 500 kilobytes or 20 total messages.  Include unseen "

"For the 'Drafts' folder, prune anything older than 6 months on the grounds "

"time, you're never going to."

"pruned according to its natural order in the list of folders; in other "
